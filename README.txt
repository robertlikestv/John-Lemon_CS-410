Assignment 2 - "John Lemon" by Robert Wilson and Foster Hobbs

Features Added:
Adjustable Enemy Line of Sight (Dot Product) - Robert Wilson
	Used dot product to calculate whether player is in view
	of enemies. Vision cones and vision distance are now 
	adjustable. As set, gargoyles are able to see farther
	but in a more narrow angle, while ghosts are able to 
	see in a wider angle but not nearly as far.

Particle Effect -

Gargoyle Alerted (Sound Effect) - Robert Wilson
	Added a sound effect where if player enters
	a gargoyle's suspicion range, a sound 
	effect plays of a voice saying "What's that?"
